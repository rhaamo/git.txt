# What

One day this will do something like Gist with pastes backed by git.

Right now it's a mess of crap.

# Sources used

I learned playing with Macaron/Xorm etc. from Gogs sources so lot of logic have been reused from Gogs.

# License

MIT, Dashie for git.txt and Gogs contributors for reused Gogs parts.
