# What

One day this will do something like Gist with pastes backed by git.

Right now it's a mess of crap.

# Use or build

    go get -u github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/...
    go get -v -insecure -u dev.sigpipe.me/dashie/git.txt

# Sources used

I learned playing with Macaron/Xorm etc. from Gogs sources so lot of logic have been reused from Gogs.

# License
