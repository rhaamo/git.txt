# What

One day this will do something like Gist with pastes backed by git.

Right now it's a mess of crap.

# Use or build

    Install or build libgit2 0.25.x ONLY. NO Version less than 0.25 (hello Debian Stable)
    go get -u github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/...
    go get -v -insecure -u dev.sigpipe.me/dashie/git.txt

# Sources used

I learned playing with Macaron/Xorm etc. from Gogs sources so lot of logic have been reused from Gogs.

# License

MIT, Dashie for git.txt and Gogs contributors for reused Gogs parts.
